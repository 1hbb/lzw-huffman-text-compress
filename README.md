### TEXT COMPRESS PROGRAM ###
<br/>

Programming Laboratory Spring Semester Project 2 Text Compress Project

<br/>

### INTRODUCTION ###
<br/>

Program "txt" files entered by user "Lzw" and "Huffman"
compresses using algorithms.
<br/>

### INSTALLING AND USAGE ###
<br/>

No setup required. "txt" file you want to compress
make sure to put it in the same folder as the "main.c" file, that is, in the project folder.

There is a test file named "text.txt" in the project folder.

When Program Executed: 
<br/>

1) First, you must enter a file name for "LZW" compression.
You can enter "text.txt" to test with the test file.
After this process, the program and the compression ratio of the original file
will print the size.
The compressed file will be written to the file named "output.txt" in the project folder.
<br/>

2) When the first process, "LZW" compression is finished, the program will ask you to "HUFFMAN" compression.
will ask you to enter a filename. You can enter "text.txt" to test with the test file.
After this process, the program and the compression ratio of the original file
will print the size.
The compressed file will be written in "file_name.cmp" format in the project folder.
